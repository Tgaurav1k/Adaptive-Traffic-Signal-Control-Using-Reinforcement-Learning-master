Traffic congestion is a major urban challenge, leading to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and pollution. Traditional traffic signal control methods rely on pre-defined timing schedules that do not adapt to real-time conditions.  It optimize signal timings dynamically, improving traffic flow efficiency.
